# SharedServices
The SmarterApp Shared Services include Core Standards, Program Management, Permissions, Portal, and Monitoring and Alerting.

Source code to Shared Services is presently maintained at https://bitbucket.org/sbacoss. This is a placeholder repository intended primarily for the collection of issues (bug reports and enhancement requests) that will inform ART development starting in July 2015.
